** Reviews

- "/Makes dealing with the reality of video lectures a bit more manageable/" - 4B CS student
- "/MY LIFE HAS CHANGED! I no longer hate watching lectures on learn :)/" - 4B CS student

** Why?

The default video and audio player on Learn does not work well enough. It's missing a lot of keyboard shortcuts, seeking tracks is not precise and does not support picture in picture, which most browsers support.

This extension replaces the default player with a [[https://videojs.com][video.js]] player.

Video.js is an extensible video player for browsers, has a lot of plugins, and is used by a lot of companies in production. Watch and Learn leverages it to offer the following features:

- playback rates up to 3x on all videos and audios
- picture in picture support
- keyboard shortcuts like 'M' to mute, 'Space' to pause/play, 'F' to fullscreen, and many more using the 'videojs-hotkeys' plugin
